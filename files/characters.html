				<h3> Sheev Palpatine </h3>
				<p>
					I love the way he takes control of the Republic and establishes "The First Galactic Empire!". 
				</p>
				<p>
					Full quote: <br>
					<i>
						The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated! Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. These have been trying times, but we have passed the test. The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger. The war is over. The Separatists have been defeated, and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning. <b>In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society</b>, which I assure you will last for ten thousand years. An Empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body and a sovereign ruler chosen for life. An Empire ruled by the majority, ruled by a new constitution! <br>

				<h3> Jace Beleren </h3>
				<b>Jace the Mind Sculptor, better than all</b>.
				<p>
					The "main character" for a lot of MtG lore. He's a mind mage from a plane starting with 'V', I don't remember the name off the top of my head. He was taught by a sphinx, but iirc the sphinx was mostly using him and not teaching him much. Jace repeatedly read some notes he hid in his room, thought with a free mind, written his conclusions on the notes and hid them back, then erased his memory so that the sphinx wouldn't know anything. He once let the sphinx break into his mind, which allowed him to wipe his own memories to also kill the sphinx, making him forget how to breathe. This event caused him to ignite his spark and planeswalk to Ravnica.
				</p>
				<p>
					He did a lot of adventuring, most notably being one of the founding members of the Gatewatch (he swore his oath as the 3rd or 4th iirc), sticking with it until it collapsed due to Gideon's sacrifice to protect Liliana during the  War of the Spark (Side note: the "Homesick" story (<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/homesick-2016-08-29">official</a>/<a href="https://github.com/maxmakesmagic/ormos/blob/bd11dee2255ee07c5f875f541080675e6392e2d9/archive/en/articles/archive/magic-story/2016/08/homesick-2016-08-29.md">ormos</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831001535/http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/homesick-2016-08-29">wayback machine</a>) was really hilarious). During contemporary mtg story, which is NOT included in my headcanon btw, he was compleated and became a phyrexian during the ONE/MOM phyrexian invasion, later becoming some kind of villain together with Vraska.
				</p>

					His best known card is ofc <code>Jace, the Mind Sculptor</code> which during it's time was banned in multiple formats and even good in Vintage. Nowadays WOTC are too scared of printing good control cards because "casual kitchen-table commander players will be salty!". The number of different custom Jace planeswalkers I've designed is probably greter than the number of people who think that MtG is in good hands right now, and definietly greter than the number of good decisions Chris Cocks has ever made.

				<p>
					Eventually, I want to have a dedicated mtg section on this website, but currently it's still under construction.

				<h3> Margo Highway Starkweather (Kuromori), the Third Toy </h3>
				<h4> Do NOT look up unless you want to pay your humanity and moral conscience as the price. You have been warned. </h4>
				<p>
				Someone on the internet recommended that I read PLIC a while back. I remember almost throwing up after the Yukino arc (the first Yukino arc, I won't write the word). And back then I was in high school! I think PLIC changed the way I think at least a little bit. Obviously, I know that's not how people behave in real life, but you can't say this... <i>thing</i> wouldn't change a person.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my opinion Margo is one of the most badass characters ever. QCQ? Check. Guns? Check. Computers? As one of the core members of Kuromori, she's the one most often monitoring everything and even rocks a Thinkpad-esque laptop. Heck, in her introduction she almost strangled Yoshida! She definitely could have been my role model if not for the novel she comes from. Is it weird to draw inspiration from PLIC? Maybe. But if you think that, it must mean you know PLIC, so you're not a saint either.

				<h3> Uncle Randy from TIS-100 </h3>
				<p>
					Not much is known about him. Iirc, only a couple lines of text are all we know. I haven't seen the end of TIS-100, I wasn't good enough when I last played it, but OMG. At the time of writing (which is around 3am localtime) I can't recall a more OP techy character, maybe besides the science guy from Back to the Future.
