		<h2>What is SPO?</h2>
		<p>
			What is SPO, you ask? SPO stands for... (drumroll please)... I don't remember what! I made up this acronym waaay back, and by now I forgot what <code>O</code> stands for. I know that <code>SP</code> stand for <code>S-Prefixed</code>, but that doesn't mean anything. So if you have any suggestions on what might <code>O</code> become, let me know! Even though I forgot the acronym, I still remember the core ideas. SPO was all about doing things yourself when possible, and not relying on others' solutions. Exactly like this webserver!
		</p>
		<h2>Why <code>S</code>?</h2>
		<p>
			Good question. Throughout my history online, I've been known by many aliases: Hihijsonel, later Sonel, and recently hhsNel or Nel. SPO was first thought of during my transition from the first to the second, and the S prefix meant "Sonel's". I could've changed the name, sure, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
		</p>
		<h2>Current SPO (may be out of date)</h2>
		<b>Please note that this paragraph may be out of date</b> <br>
		<p>
			The current SPO is pretty small, consisting of projects that are both <i>good</i> (maybe half of what I write) and <i>public</i> (again around half). In a Venn diagram those two intersect into a superset of SPO. At the time of writing the most notable SPO entries are this server (currently named <code>server</code>, name change pending) and <code>sDGen</code>, a documentation generator.
		</p>
		<h2>Contributing...?</h2>
		<p>
			I'm flattered. But... there are some hoops you have to jump through to protect SPO from low-effort (read: AI generated) slop and make it into something for the people. Any more-than-specialized project (something that can be adapted to work for a non-one number of usecases) could become a part of SPO, provided it meets those requirements:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It can be used by anyone with sufficient knowledge not of the program, but of the ideas it operates around</li>
			<li>It's open-source and written in a well-designed language (examples: <code>C</code>, in particular <code>C99</code>; <code>bash</code>)</li>
			<li>It is not written in a terrible way (most of the code can be understood at a glance by a person knowing the language)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If your work satisfies these, I'd consider it very good and something I'd be proud of were it part of SPO. If you want me to add it to the list above, contact me.
